Add4MomCovMatrixCharged:
A Marlin processor for filling the covariance matrix in (P,E) space for
PandoraPFOs.

Description:
Takes as input one collection of ReconstructedParticle (default is PandoraPFOs).
No new collections are created: the input collection itself is modified.
That means this collection should not be read from disk (a slcio file),
it should be on memory.

This processor can be plugin in the official reconstruction steering file
right after MarlinPandora: thereby the output PandoraPFOs will have set the
covariance matrix.

In the example directory there is one steering file
example_covmatrix.xml

This steering file is the ILD official steering file for the reconstruction
at 250 GeV.
To run the example you need to edit as follows:

%%INPUT%%         ---> input  simulated file
%%OUTPUT-REC%%    ---> output reconstructed file
%%OUTPUT-DST%%    ---> output reconstructed DST file
%%INPUT-OVERLAY%% ---> input overlay aa->hadrons file
